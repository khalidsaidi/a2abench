Hi! The official MCP registry shows io.github.khalidsaidi/a2abench latest as v0.1.14, but Remote MCP Servers is still displaying an older version.

Official registry latest:
https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0.1/servers/io.github.khalidsaidi%2Fa2abench/versions/latest

Could you trigger a refresh/resync for this entry?
Thanks!
